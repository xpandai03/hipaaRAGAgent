# N8N RAG Integration - Implementation Status

## ✅ Completed Updates (Based on Instructions)

### 1. Document Upload Integration
**Status: READY TO TEST**

- ✅ Created new endpoint `/api/documents/upload-n8n/route.ts`
- ✅ Sends actual file via multipart/form-data to N8N
- ✅ Correct webhook URL: `https://n8n-service-nxvg.onrender.com/webhook/process-user-document`
- ✅ Includes: file, user_id, filename in FormData
- ✅ File type validation (PDF, DOCX, DOC, TXT, MD)
- ✅ Retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts, 30s timeout)

### 2. RAG Query Integration
**Status: READY TO TEST**

- ✅ Updated N8N client to use `/webhook/user-rag-query` endpoint
- ✅ Added session_id parameter for conversation context
- ✅ Changed default top_k from 5 to 4 (as per instructions)
- ✅ Added retry logic with exponential backoff
- ✅ Chat route now passes thread ID as session_id

### 3. Error Handling
**Status: IMPLEMENTED**

- ✅ 3-retry policy with exponential backoff
- ✅ 30-second timeout for Render cold starts
- ✅ Graceful degradation (chat works without RAG if N8N fails)
- ✅ Meaningful error messages

### 4. User Isolation
**Status: CONFIGURED**

- ✅ Using Clerk user ID consistently across all N8N calls
- ✅ Each user's data completely isolated
- ✅ N8N will create per-user tables automatically

## 📋 How to Test

### Test Document Upload:
1. Go to **http://localhost:3001/documents**
2. Click "Upload Document"
3. Select a PDF, DOCX, or MD file
4. Watch for processing status
5. Check N8N logs for webhook receipt

### Test RAG Chat:
1. Go to **http://localhost:3001/chat**
2. Enable RAG in Settings (⚙️ button)
3. Ask a question about uploaded documents
4. Should see context being used in response

## 🔌 Webhook Endpoints

```javascript
// Document Processing
POST https://n8n-service-nxvg.onrender.com/webhook/process-user-document
Body: FormData with file, user_id, filename

// RAG Query
POST https://n8n-service-nxvg.onrender.com/webhook/user-rag-query
Body: JSON with user_id, query, top_k, session_id
```

## 🚀 Key Changes from Previous Implementation

1. **Stopped saving to local database** - N8N handles all storage
2. **Using multipart/form-data** for file uploads (not JSON)
3. **Correct N8N endpoints** (user-rag-query not user-rag-search)
4. **Added session_id** for conversation context
5. **Proper retry logic** for Render cold starts

## ⚠️ What N8N Expects

### For Document Upload:
- FormData with actual file object
- user_id for isolation
- filename for reference

### For RAG Query:
- user_id to search user's documents
- query text
- top_k (number of chunks)
- session_id for conversation context

## 📝 Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `/app/api/documents/upload-n8n/route.ts` - New upload endpoint for N8N

### Modified Files:
- `/lib/n8n-rag-client.ts` - Updated endpoints and retry logic
- `/app/api/chat/route.ts` - Pass session_id, use Clerk user ID
- `/components/document-upload.tsx` - Use new N8N endpoint
- `/prisma/schema.prisma` - Added processingStatus fields
- `/.env.local` - Added N8N endpoint variables

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Upload a PDF document
- [ ] Verify N8N webhook receives file
- [ ] Check processing completes
- [ ] Ask question about document content
- [ ] Verify RAG context in response
- [ ] Test with multiple users
- [ ] Verify user isolation

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If upload fails:
- Check N8N workflow is active
- Verify webhook URL is correct
- Check file type is supported
- Look for retry attempts in console

### If RAG doesn't work:
- Ensure RAG is enabled in Settings
- Check N8N user-rag-query webhook is active
- Verify user has uploaded documents
- Check console for retry attempts

The system is now properly integrated with N8N's expectations!
